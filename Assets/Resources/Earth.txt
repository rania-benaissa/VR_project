Earth is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets, and the only astronomical object known to harbour life.

According to evidence from radiometric dating and other sources, Earth was formed about 4.54 billion years ago. Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon.
During one orbit around the Sun, Earth rotates about its own axis 366.26 times,creating 365.26 solar days or one sidereal year. 

Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 away from the perpendicular of its orbital plane, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface with a period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days).

      The Earth System
Among the eight major planets, Earth is the only one with a single moon. 
Over millennia, our planet’s celestial companion has assumed many roles: Its shifting, glowing face has inspired myths and legends; its cratered surface continues to be a prime destination for robotic and human explorers; and its gravitational heft and silvery light tangibly affect life on this planet.

The Moon is Earth's only permanent natural satellite. Its gravitational interaction with Earth causes ocean tides, stabilizes the orientation of Earth's rotational axis,and gradually slows Earth's rotational rate.

Likely born from a fiery collision between Earth and a Mars-size planet, the moon was once a quivering mass of magma. Over eons, it solidified into the orb we see today. Whether crescent, half, or full, the moon keeps one face perpetually pointed toward Earth. Its near-side complexion is a mottled mix of dark patches—the sites of ancient lava seas—and gleaming, cratered landscapes. The lunar far side is completely different, with a mix of highlands and complex terrains.
