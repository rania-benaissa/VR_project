Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. 
Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. 
For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants.
Uranus's atmosphere, although similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, contains more "ices", such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.
It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224.2 °C), and has a complex, layered cloud structure, with water thought to make up the lowest clouds, and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. 
The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock

	Uranus System

Ice giant Uranus is swarmed by more than two dozen moons, five of which are notably large. These major moons were known before Voyager 2 swung by the tipped-over planet in 1986 and discovered 10 additional satellites. Since then, though, no spacecraft has visited Uranus or Neptune, meaning that imagery from these planets’ neighborhoods is sparse, and astronomers have had to rely on Earth-based telescopes to study both systems.
